I love to travel.

And I love photography. So naturally whenever I visit a new place I bring my camera along to capture those memories and amazing sights while I am far away from home.

Here I have compiled a few of my favourite travel tips to help those of you planning on exploring some photographic opportunities on your next holiday getaway.

### **Planning ahead**

My first tip is don't overpack. So many times I will bring one or two lenses more than I needed only to never use them. The less equipment you are required to lug around the more likely you will be to take it with you once you are at your destination. Keep your travel kit light and efficient and you will save yourself the burden of a sore back from carrying unnecessary gear around day after day.

### **Be familiar with your gear**

Don't bring the latest kit! This is not a time to experiment to try out a new camera body or tripod!

When you are visiting a new location stick with what your know. Use the camera you are most comfortable with so you're not wasting time learning your gear while trying to capturing those prefect moments. You are there to relax, not be stressed out. Shoot what you know and love. The more relaxed you are, the better your photos will be.

Try to avoid anything that will get between you and making a great photo.

That being said, a good ND or polarising filter can't hurt.

### **Make friends with the locals**

When visiting new places try to capture some images of the people around you. Nothing helps to tell a story about a location better than the people who live there. A language barrier may get in the way, but always try to make a connection with your subjects. Make sure you smile a lot and acknowledge your camera when trying to take pictures of people. I also find that it helps to carry a small notebook business cards along. I usually try to offer to email a photo to my subject and send a nice thank you note.

### **Lens choices**

When you are in a location with a lot of action, you can try a good telephoto lens to get your shots from a distance, but a wide angle lens may make for a better shot if you're lucky enough to be right in the middle of the action.

Anytime you are in a new place you will come across a lot of unusual subjects that will force you to ask yourself "how can I shoot that?" Use your eye and think about what you want to capture before turning on your camera.

### **Workflow**

Try to get into a habit each evening to go through your photos and back them up. Nothing is worse than spending days capturing images from a once in a lifetime holiday only to find that your memory card was lost or corrupted.

I'm lucky that the SONY A7Rii has Wifi built in so I can transfer photos to my mobile on the go (although this does tend to be quite the battery hog...)

I often leave my laptop at home and only travel with my iPad, using the Lightning to SD card reader to offload my photos each day. A great addition if your camera is not Wi-if enabled (or you need to reserve some precious battery). It works on your iPhone as well, and gives you the opportunity to send some of your key photos to Instagram while on the go!

Another great option for backing up in the field is an external hard drive with built in SD reader. I like the Western Digital My Passport Wireless Pro.

It gives you portable storage to easily offload, edit and backup photos in the field. With an SD card reader built-in, you get an all-in-one drive to streamline your workflow and a battery that provides up to 10 hours of continuous use.

As an added bonus you can even stream for your iTunes content over the built in 802.11ac Wi-fi to a connected tablet or laptop. (Watch your own videos instead of paying for the overpriced Pay-Per-View at your hotel!)

## **Tips recap:**

1. Plan ahead when packing for your trip.
2. Know your gear. Only bring equipment you're comfortable with.
3. Respect the people around you.
4. Consider your lens choices. Both wide and telephoto may be in order depending on your plan.
5. Don't forget your Workflow. Every evening sit down to edit and backup your photos.
